Sprint 1:
Legacy backend code that is partly written in Scala 2 was transferred into this project, commented in detail to avoid confusions while using old code.
The backend code includes all the variables and fuctions for KanbanApp, Board, Stage, Card, Interaction, Checklist, Tag, and Checklist classes and related classes.
The code is tested superficially by using REPL with simple commands.

There are noticed to be possible problems with IO-handling which will be fixed after building a working GUI.

First steps to build GUI is made, very simple draft is made ready by using Scene Builder.
